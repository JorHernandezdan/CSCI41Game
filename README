The current plan is to create a top-down game in which the player has control
of the "player". The goal is to have the player complete a maze while trying
to defuse as many bombs as possible. The player will be awarded pts per
hostage saved.
-wire minigame
-variable on bomb to count points
-display time till next detonation at bottom 
--based off of heap
